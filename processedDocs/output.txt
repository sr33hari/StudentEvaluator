STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
Statement of Purpose of
"Speed. Faster than fast, quicker than quick. I am Lightning." - Lightning McQueen. The ingenuous
8 year old me, inspired by anthropomorphic cars, was eager to be the fastest at everything. With this
newfound zeal, I ensured that I fulfilled my desires, whether it was to achieve the highest grade in class,
to win a quiz, or to outperform others in abacus competitions. Being an avid fan of Formula 1, I acknowl-
edge the impact of a fraction of a second in information flow and the ramifications it may have on end
results. My experience in designing algorithms and conceptual understanding of networks deepened my
realization of how existing designs can be transformed into vastly superior models by optimization. I am
keen on improving the efficiency of algorithms and networks, by fortifying my skills at the
University (SJSU).
In my first semester of college, I witnessed real-world applications of algorithmic solutions, when I
attended a roadshow presented by
, a lab setup in
that funds
internships and events for selected students in college. Determined to bolster my experience in inter-
domain projects, I was among the top 4% of freshmen who secured an internship at the lab for the
summer. I worked on a project that detects user sentiments in a Twitter account over a period of time
and provides suggestions to lift the mood of the user, by using events detected in their positively catego-
rized tweets. This project was awarded 4th place amidst 25 teams in
’s “Power Of Connected
Hackathon”. My knack for public speaking, people management, logistical skills, and contributions to the
projects, earned me the prestigious role as the student head for the lab, where I co-led the internship
program for 40 students, the following year. Constant involvement in the student community, shouldering
responsibilities for events, winning beatbox competitions, partaking in team sports, and regularly con-
tributing to
which aims to counter classroom hunger and aid education of
underprivileged kids have broadly developed my personality.
The level of efficiency with which Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks share large files at blazing speeds ex-
cites me. Intrigued by the piece selection algorithm, I implemented a pure P2P chat and file sharing client
that was tested on multiple users and successfully transferred large files through the campus network. My
professor’s valuable insights on data-stealing vulnerabilities that my implementation was susceptible to
taught me about how it can be optimized into a hybrid P2P network. The depth of complexity in Net-
working inspired me to choose
(
) and
electives for my 6th semester.
I studied the use of
devices infected with the
virus to launch a
attack during the
course and it compelled me to find a solution to BotNet attacks using
devices. I collaborated with
my teammates to explore how using
’ underlying protocols can aid in masking
data packets from external networks. I was exposed to various technologies in the field, such as
and
to
Tunneling Protocols that were used for testing this theory. We were successful in
preventing packet sniffing and man in the middle attacks through this research endeavor. This work was
presented at the ICCCES 2019 conference and subsequently published in a reputed Springer journal.
Wanting to extend my boundaries in conducting research, my hard work and perseverance earned me
an internship at
(ISRO). During my internship, I worked on a
project that aimed to find the polynomial that represented the most influential features for any given
data-set, as a combination of
polynomials. I optimized the evaluation of the best fitting polyno-
mial by using greedy methods gleaned from the
elective. This work was extremely
enriching as it allowed me to collaborate with brilliant scientists in
in charge of
orbital control of satellites.

The
documentary “The So al Dilemma” displayed how so al media can be leveraged as a
tool to sway the opinions of the masses. Witnessing the negative effects of misinformation spread and
biased opinions on the CAA-NRC legislation that was shared on
inspired me to work on the
problem, as a part of my capstone project in my final semester. Our team analyzed
users who
had any activity regarding the topic and classified their tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using
stance detection. Working on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks as part of
elective enabled me to duly apply my knowledge and implement a multiclass classifier using
bi-directional LSTMs and
. Unsettled by the initial accuracy, I procured
a much larger data set from Dr.
from
that helped our model
achieve a 93% accuracy in classifying tweets. The established metrics resulted in successfully detecting
bots and identifying accounts that were spreading propaganda. This echoed the observation from “The
So al Dilemma” where a user was influenced by an online profile that led to his arrest. With invaluable
mentorship from Prof.
, this study was published in
in Data
Mining and Information Security book as part of the proceedings in the IEMIS 2020 conference.
Alongside the capstone project, I opted to pursue an internship at
(
), Ben-
galuru as a Software Developer for five months, where my technical competence and commitment earned
me an offer for the role of a permanent employee. Using my strong foundation in
and Python program-
ming, I contributed to modifying and developing new REST APIs, Angular applications, AWS
,
and setting up the
/CD infrastructure for a centralized service. Consistently exceeding expectations
and being a strong performer, I was recognized and awarded multiple prizes and several appre ation
emails. This professional asso ation enabled me to learn multiple tech stacks and implement practical
solutions with utmost commitment to deliver impactful work while working within strict boundaries of
time. I intend to complement my learning in the industry with a master’s degree in
to develop skills
that will be valuable in my goal to build optimized networks and systems.
in
promises to give me a taste of all aspects of networking and systems
pertinent to my areas of interest. I wish to gain insights in this direction, by opting for courses on
,
, and
, taught by revered professors Dr.
, Dr.
and Dr.
. Published work on "Overlapping Community Detection"
and "Fake News Analysis and Graph Classification" by Dr.
are examples of projects that
I would like to build upon. I am captivated by the prospect of unearthing insights on how the effects of
so al networks influence individuals.
The heavy influence technology has on our minds is exponentially greater than any previous genera-
tion. It is of paramount importance that we solve issues in a manner that does not have profound negative
impacts on the human mind and so ety. The wealth of knowledge I will amass from graduate courses,
combined with my strong foundation in
and experience in conducting research will
equip me with technical skills to build scalable, effi ent, and ethical software and systems.
Initiatives such as CommUniver
ty are spe fically relevant to my interests and highlight the support
that
provides for holistic development. Furthermore, I am keen on joining student organizations
such as
and
to collaborate with like-minded individ-
uals from across dis plines, as well as be in touch with its illustrious Alumni Network.
I am glad that the mission of
is to ensure the responsible de-
velopment of systems and networks to benefit so ety. It reassures me that
will be the perfect
university for me to explore the interdis plinary links between networking, algorithms, and governance
for the betterment of so ety.

It is my pleasure to recommend 
 for the graduate course in 
 at 
your prestigious university. I have had the opportunity to observe 
 closely from various 
perspectives – as my student, research student and thesis project evaluator over a period of 3 
semesters. He stood out as an extremely intuitive and capable student. I am happy to hear that 
he wants to pursue a career in this field and is working accordingly to achieve his goal. 
 
I have known 
 since his 6th semester when I taught him a course on 
 followed by a course on 
 the following semester. 
 was a top 
student of my class both in terms of his grade in the course and qualities that he possesses 
beyond the transcript. He would be zealous in taking up practical network attack simulations and 
went the extra mile to stay up to date in the world of attacks on corporations and breaches of 
networks. 
 was specially interested in the social engineering aspects of many case studies, 
such as those of breaches using stuxnet in 
’s nuclear facility and 
 along with the 
technicalities.  
 
I agreed to guide 
 due to his enthusiasm and analytical skills. He worked on an approach to 
secure wireless Internet of Things (
) Networks without increasing the cost of 
 systems, 
majorly changing network topology or adversely affecting any other unique selling points of 
.  
This was achieved by clustering microcontrollers in physical proximity to use a single device for 
connecting to the edge device. This link was secured using an efficient tunnelling protocol for all 
communication. This approach was built for and tested on an automated classroom setup and 
was successful in preventing packet sniffing and external control of the devices which could 
make them a part of a botnet. This approach required no changes in the existent 
 
architecture and only minor changes in the network topology. The research resulted in a paper 
presented at 
, 
 in 
, 
 and published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Electrical 
Engineering series. 
’s quirky and out of the box thinking was seen when the team had to 
solve issues with hardware. He was able to overcome tunnel vision by repeated swapping of 
work between team members that led to quick resolution to the problems that arose. He proved 
to be capable of delegating work that maximised each team member’s skills and working in a 
dynamic environment. 
 
I am of the opinion that 
 is prepared for graduate school on account of his proven 
persistence, resilience, and analytical ability. His industrial experience which involved building 
end to end applications has given him a better idea about the practical aspects of 
 and will aid his ability to fulfil the requirements for graduate school. With great 
conviction I can recommend that 
 would be an excellent fit for your graduate cohort.

 was a top student of my class both in terms of his grade in
the course and qualities that he possesses beyond the transcript. In class, he was an active
listener and he always participated in discussions. He took on every assignment, even the
optional ones, in stride and saw to their timely completion.
As his thesis project evaluator I was impressed by the detail and preparedness of his demos and
presentations. His project involved detection of bias in a set of tweets regarding a certain topic.
It started out as a community detection algorithm but transformed iteratively into a use case
that was experimented on real time data. He was able to overcome the initial ambiguity with the
problem statement in a very short span of time and made excellent use of the feedback to deliver
a clear goal at the following presentation. 
 was extremely enthusiastic about improving the
accuracy of the stance detection and procured data from 
 in 
to train his model better. The results were accurate in terms of showing how specific accounts
brought bias into the community. These findings were published in the Emerging Technologies
in 
 journal.
 was also very active in volunteering his time towards the university’s co-curricular
activities.
He has assumed several leadership roles while organizing multiple events. 
 has excellent
communication skills which were seen first hand when he had to organise events and host panel
evaluators during the annual exhibition,
